Now it\u2019s a heck of a finisher, albeit most likely on the turn afterwards when you\u2019ve put a bunch of counters on stuff. Also the backside doesn\u2019t buff your whole board both to save space and because pro artifacts on everything was unbeatable against the wrong decks. Also gave it first strike because why not make it cracked to fight against? That\u2019s Dunban over there.\n2.2.1: Put back to 5 mana now that the tokens are 1/1s again. Made the defense 4 so that the tokens can\u2019t flip it the turn of, but you only need two buffed tokens on the next turn to flip it. Also just made Dunban\u2019s protection just work on artifact creatures."}
