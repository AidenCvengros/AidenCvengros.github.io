There were too many black cards crowded at 5+ mana. This gets an effect out of there, gives a nice piece for the golgari and orzhov archetypes to consider, and makes for a flashy buildaround for rakdos to try and crew. Could maybe go up to four mana and only pay 2 life, but I wanted it at 3 for now to fill out blacks curve better."}
