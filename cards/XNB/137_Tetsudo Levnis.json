Red felt like it needed another vehicle that did nonvehicle things, as well as Prog Ares being legendary was hurting it\u2019s utility, so this fills in the legendary slot.\n2.2.0: Took the place of Prospectors Amdusias since that card got a more flavorful ability.\n2.2.1: Moved up to five mana as stuff got shifted. Became the topple cannon. I liked the topple crew but this definitely also still does stuff but now has more distinct modes."}
